Features to add:

- Search when typing (if the user wants it that way)
- Search on Enter (if the user wants it to work like that instead of when typing)
- An option to hide the Search button if the user wants to
- Updating the XML file from the Options window.
- Functionality for the menubar items, like File\Exit, Tools\Options, and Help\About.

Some more features need to be added to this list from my OneNote notebook.
